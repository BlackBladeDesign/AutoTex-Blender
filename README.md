This script is a Blender add-on that automates the process of setting up texture nodes for a material in the Shader Editor. Specifically, it loads three textures: ORM (Occlusion, Roughness, and Metallic), normal map, and base color textures, and builds a node tree from them. The add-on creates two operators: "Auto Load" and "Load From Path." When "Auto Load" is selected, the add-on creates the necessary nodes and sets their properties to load the textures for the current material. When "Load From Path" is selected, the user can specify the path where the textures are located. The script also includes a panel that appears in the Shader Editor's options panel, allowing the user to select these operators. The script also includes a check to see if a "glTF Material Output" node is present in the node tree. If it is, the add-on will add it to the node tree; otherwise, it will create a new "glTF Settings" node tree with an "Occlusion" input socket.
